A new demo where I use a string melody I came up with while playing on my keyboard. It sounds amazing so far, and I definitely wanna make a proper song out of it!

Yeah, I'm doing a remix of New Order's "Blue Mondays", because this masterpiece recently turned 40. It's really fun to work with it honestly
