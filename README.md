# OpticTeadrop's absolutely-rad Website
A personal website with my audio demos and other stuff

Hosting it here on GitHub 'cause I like the site and it's easy to set up

(previously "OptimisticTeardrop's absolutely-rad Website", but I decided to change my name everywhere I can because it's shorter and I prefer it tbh)

I'm prolly gonna overhaul this at some point, hang tight!
